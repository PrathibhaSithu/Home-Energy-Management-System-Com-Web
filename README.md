# Project Description
  ### As the demand for sustainable living grows, homes must evolve to manage resources efficiently and safely. The Home Energy Management System (HEMS) integrates solar, electricity, gas/fire, and water management systems into a single AI-powered platform. A key feature is the Solar Energy Management module, which uses AI techniques like long short-term memory (LSTM) and reinforcement learning to predict solar generation, schedule energy use, and manage hybrid storage systems‚Äîmaximizing solar utilization and reducing grid dependence. The system also ensures safety with gas leak and fire detection using deep learning, real-time computer vision, and automated shutoff controls. Water usage is tracked with sensors and machine learning to detect leaks or overuse. Electricity management automates appliances based on occupancy, tariffs, and environment. A user-friendly web and mobile interface offers real-time monitoring, smart recommendations, and voice control. Modular and scalable, HEMS supports future features like EV charging and smart microgrid integration, making homes safer, greener, and more efficient.
